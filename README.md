Racecarts++ is an updated version of [Firebug's _Faster Minecarts Datapack_](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/faster-minecarts-datapack/) from 2019. I've updated it so that it works on any block, and can handle very tight corners as seen in many designs for automated rail stations.

Racecarts++ is **robust**: it's compatible with piston bolts, it only affects player-ridden carts, and can handle corners and starting and stopping in a Vanilla-compatible way (so that it doesn't break any train station machinery you might have!).

Carts travel at 28 m/s (↑ from 8 m/s in Vanilla), which is faster than Elytra rocket spam, but slower than Blue Ice. This is balanced in that it is more powerful than the Elytra (which many think is too far overpowered), but slower than Packed/Blue Ice boating—which requires a learning curve to use and lots of materials. This **balances out Minecarts** again to be a viable form of transportation for routes you frequently travel, where you can invest in a Minecart line between two points that will outpace using your Elytra all of the time.

* Lightweight

That's literally it!
